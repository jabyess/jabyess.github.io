    <h1 class="title">Notes from searching for meaning in work</h1>
    <p>I'm trying to find out what to do with my life. Writing code and managing doesn't seem to be it anymore.</p>
<p>Therefore, enjoy my notes from a couple hours of good old-fashioned internet reading. its not even slightly finished, so be warned.</p>
<ul>
<li>recently found the site lesswrong. it has <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uwmFSaDMprsFkpWet/explore-more-a-bag-of-tricks-to-keep-your-life-on-the-rails">this post which i really like</a>
<ul>
<li>pick a direction, not a goal</li>
<li>exploit your natural motivations</li>
<li>i think i want to work with people, in some capacity. interpersonal stuff matters a lot to me</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>that led me to read more on lesswrong, and discovered the section of &quot;inspirational intro posts&quot; which included <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ur9TCRnHJighHmLCW/on-caring">this</a>
<ul>
<li>your feelings aren't representative of severity, they can lie to you, its hard to comprehend scale and large numbers, and thus your feelings don't scale</li>
<li>basically talks about how to change your mind about caring, that it's not important to feel that you care, but to take some positive action anyway</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>that led to reading more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism">effective altruism</a>
<ul>
<li>i had heard of it, but only loosely</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>related: charitable giving effectively
<ul>
<li>It's important to give to the right causes because your dollar can be significantly more impactful if you give to a charity or organization that is well-run and efficiently managed</li>
<li><a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/">charity navigator</a> is a place to evaluate charity effectiveness &amp; overhead</li>
<li><a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/cause-areas">give to the right causes</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>found 80000 hours blog, and ordered their free book about how to find a meaningful career.
<ul>
<li>i bet the book is just the same as the career guide online, but we'll see</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>career guide: https://80000hours.org/career-guide/introduction</li>
<li>80k hours career guide part 1  - <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/job-satisfaction/">job satisfaction</a>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If this were a normal career guide, we’d start by getting you to write out a list of what you most want from a job, like “working outdoors” and “working with ambitious people.” The bestselling career advice book of all time, <em>What Color is Your Parachute</em>, recommends exactly this. The hope is that, deep down, people know what they really want.</p>
<p>However, research shows that although self-reflection is useful, it only goes so far.</p>
<p>You can probably think of times in your own life when you were excited about a holiday or party — but when it actually happened, it was just OK. In the last few decades, research has shown that this is common: we’re not always great at predicting what will make us most happy, and we don’t realise how bad we are.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>tl;dr the whole &quot;follow your passion&quot; idea is flawed</li>
<li>80k hours part 2 - <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/can-one-person-make-a-difference/">impact</a>
<ul>
<li>if you want to do high-impact work, you probably need to do something unconventional. like being a doctor in a less-developed country is a much bigger impact than doing it in the US or UK, because there are fewer doctors and the need is higher</li>
</ul>
