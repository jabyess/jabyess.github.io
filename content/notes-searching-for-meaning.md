title: Notes from searching for meaning in work
tags: notes
---

I'm trying to find out what to do with my life. Writing code and managing doesn't seem to be it anymore. 

Therefore, enjoy my notes from a couple hours of good old-fashioned internet reading. its not even slightly finished, so be warned.

- recently found the site lesswrong. it has [this post which i really like](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uwmFSaDMprsFkpWet/explore-more-a-bag-of-tricks-to-keep-your-life-on-the-rails)
	- pick a direction, not a goal
	- exploit your natural motivations
	- i think i want to work with people, in some capacity. interpersonal stuff matters a lot to me
- that led me to read more on lesswrong, and discovered the section of "inspirational intro posts" which included [this](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ur9TCRnHJighHmLCW/on-caring)
	- your feelings aren't representative of severity, they can lie to you, its hard to comprehend scale and large numbers, and thus your feelings don't scale
	- basically talks about how to change your mind about caring, that it's not important to feel that you care, but to take some positive action anyway
- that led to reading more about [effective altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism)
	- i had heard of it, but only loosely
- related: charitable giving effectively
	- It's important to give to the right causes because your dollar can be significantly more impactful if you give to a charity or organization that is well-run and efficiently managed
	- [charity navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/) is a place to evaluate charity effectiveness & overhead
	- [give to the right causes](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/cause-areas)
- found 80000 hours blog, and ordered their free book about how to find a meaningful career. 
	- i bet the book is just the same as the career guide online, but we'll see
- career guide: https://80000hours.org/career-guide/introduction
- 80k hours career guide part 1  - [job satisfaction](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/job-satisfaction/):
> If this were a normal career guide, we’d start by getting you to write out a list of what you most want from a job, like “working outdoors” and “working with ambitious people.” The bestselling career advice book of all time, _What Color is Your Parachute_, recommends exactly this. The hope is that, deep down, people know what they really want.

> However, research shows that although self-reflection is useful, it only goes so far.
> 
> You can probably think of times in your own life when you were excited about a holiday or party — but when it actually happened, it was just OK. In the last few decades, research has shown that this is common: we’re not always great at predicting what will make us most happy, and we don’t realise how bad we are.
- tl;dr the whole "follow your passion" idea is flawed
- 80k hours part 2 - [impact](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/can-one-person-make-a-difference/)
	- if you want to do high-impact work, you probably need to do something unconventional. like being a doctor in a less-developed country is a much bigger impact than doing it in the US or UK, because there are fewer doctors and the need is higher
