if i put this in here, does it count as a post

i wanted to write a blog because

- sharing ideas
- figuring out my own ideas
- creating something permanent, so that future me can look back on it and see what i was doing then
- putting something out in the world that's creative
- i'm unemployed

i want to do this imperfectly. doing it badly is better than not doing it at all. and hopefully in the process, i will get better. and the blog will get better. and i will learn more about myself.
