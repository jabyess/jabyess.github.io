This is the blog of Jimmy Byess, who at some unknown point in the past decided to adopt the moniker **skelios**.

## FAQ

### Who is Jimmy?

That's a really hard question to answer. He's a guy on the internet who has had [lots of different jobs](/career-evolution). He's a father and a husband. He lives in new york city. He rides bicycles and bakes bread. He has an interest in computery things, but also reading long-form literature, listening to all kinds of music, and meditating.  

### What does skelios mean?

Nothing. It's just a name that was picked based on a few criteria:

- fairly unique, so not likely to be taken as a handle on whatever websites i want to use it on
- easy to pronounce (if you are an american english speaker)
- not a real word
- the domain was available
